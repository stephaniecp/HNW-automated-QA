3/19/23 - Updating Selenium & Chrome Driver
Ran iinto issue with Selenium Webdrive and Chrome webdriver out of date. 
Updated package.jason Dependencies to "*" (for latest) instead of fixed version numbers. Found which dependencies was out of date by running "npm outdated" and "npm update" to updale all depedencies and "npm update --save" to save them to package.json. 
After running that last command to save, package.json updates the Depedencies to the latest versions.
